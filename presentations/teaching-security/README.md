# Security Teaching
__Those who can't do: teach.__

## Sylabus
### 1. PWK, OSCP, WTF
This is mainly just meant as a quick introduction to what I'm intending to teach, the kind of things I want to cover and some terminology that people might need to be aware of

### 2. Setting up a PenTesting Environment
We'll need a place to try out and to demonstrate the stuff we'll learn, so in this series of slides I'll be going through some tips to setting up your own environment.
I'm also working on a system that i'll hopefully be releasing that'll make this even easier to setup, but I'm having a few teething problems at the moment


### 3. A few linux basics
In Kali (and hacking in general), it's good to know some of the more fundemental ways of working with linux to get the things you want. This presentation is mainly to go through things like `grep`, `ps`, terminal re-direction and other things you'll want to know when navigating and investigating a linux system.
