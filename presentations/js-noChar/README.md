# I can write my webscript with no Alpha chars

## What are these other scripts?
They're things I wrote for the presentation that automate a few things.
Particularly the `automatedWats.js` file, which automates the section I _would_ do in a `node -i` shell if doing live.
All scripts are self running (and totes harmless, I promise).

`consoleProcessEnv.fuck.js` is just `console.log(process.env)` written and executed via jsfuck.
