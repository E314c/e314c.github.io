_because it's free_

[Link to the site](https://e314c.github.io/)

This is mainly a place for me to start putting any stuff that I want hosted for free.

I won't list my plans here because I'll inevitably not stick to them :upside_down_face:

## Presentations
All presentations in this folder are freely available to anyone. Feel free to use the slide decks if you feel they will help you teach people something.

Obviously I'd appreciate some attribution and feedback, but don't let that stop you from helping people learn (even if it's just from my mistakes).
